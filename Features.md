ðŸš€ Next Steps

To complete the full ERP system, you'll need to:

# Connect to Supabase - Click the "Connect to Supabase" button to set up your database
# Database Setup - I'll create the complete database schema with all tables and RLS policies
# Complete All Modules - Implement the remaining 12+ modules (Staff, Attendance, Exams, etc.)
# File Upload System - Set up Supabase Storage for documents and photos
# PDF Generation - Implement ID cards and certificate generation


The system is now running with a beautiful, professional interface. You can log in using the demo credentials (admin@school.com / password123) to explore the dashboard and student management features.

Would you like me to proceed with setting up the complete database schema and implementing more modules?
